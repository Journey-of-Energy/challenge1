## My process

I created a React project, and started to build components and parts of the assignment one by one and while doing this i was setting up some basics of responsive design. After the whole design was finished, i focused on responsivity until i was satisfied with results. After that, i just deployed the project.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MUI](https://mui.com) - Rect library for styling components

### What I learned

I had basics of React, that i trained a little, but new thing for me was MUI library. I learn a lot how to style components with MUI, and most importantly, i found out pretty cool tricks with MUI for responsive design.

### Continued development

I enjoyed working on this project, and i can definetely imagine myself doing other, later more complex projects and assignments like this.
